# This project has moved

**This repository now lives on [Codeberg].**

GitHub is a software forge that is now actively hostile to open-source maintainers, by introducing new artificial
"intelligence" features[^1], the primary purpose of which is to waste maintainer time by creating issues and pull requests
that nobody bothered to write, systematically disregarding copyright when it's convenient for them,[^2] and the original
license that the code was written under.

This is deeply unacceptable, and I am no longer willing to host my projects on a software forge that is
as maintainer-hostile as GitHub is.
